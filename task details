3 task :-

Classes and Their Responsibilities
Student Class:

Represents a student with a name and a list of courses.
Contains methods to add courses and retrieve student information.

Course Class:

Represents a course with a name, score, and calculated grade.
Calculates and assigns a grade based on the score when a course object is created.

GradingSystem Class:

Main class that extends JFrame to create the GUI.
Contains a list of students and GUI components for user input and output display.

Key Components and Methods

User Interface (UI) Initialization:

Initializes the main frame, sets its properties, and arranges the layout using BorderLayout.
Creates an input panel with fields for student name, course name, and score, along with buttons for adding courses and viewing grades.
Adds a combo box to select students and a text area to display grades.

Adding Courses:

addCourse() method retrieves user inputs, validates them, creates a new course, and associates it with the student.
If the student does not exist, a new student is created and added to the list and combo box.
Viewing Grades:

viewGrades() method retrieves the selected student's courses, calculates the average score, and determines the overall grade.
Displays the details in the text area.

Helper Methods:

findStudent(String name): Searches for a student by name in the list of students.
calculateOverallGrade(double averageScore): Calculates the overall grade based on the average score.

Event Handling:-

Action listeners are added to the buttons to handle user interactions.
addCourse() is called when the "Add Course" button is clicked.
viewGrades() is called when the "View Grades" button is clicked.
Main Method
Launches the application by creating an instance of GradingSystem and setting it visible.

4.task:-

Main Class:

Extends JFrame to create the main game window.
Initializes the user interface and sets window properties.
Contains the main method to launch the game.

Game Class:

Extends JPanel and contains the main game logic and rendering.
Manages the game state, including the snake, the cherry (food), the score, and the game status.
Handles the game loop, updating the game state, rendering the graphics, and processing user input via key events.

Snake Class:

Represents the snake with a head, a direction, and a list of tail segments.
Contains methods to move the snake, add a tail segment, and change direction.

Point Class:

Represents a point on the screen with x and y coordinates.
Contains methods for movement, comparison, and collision detection.
Direction Enum:

Represents the possible directions the snake can move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
Contains helper methods to determine if a direction is along the x or y axis.

GameStatus Enum:

Represents the different states of the game (NOT_STARTED, RUNNING, PAUSED, GAME_OVER).
Key Components and Methods

Game Class (Detailed):

Initialization:

Loads the cherry image.
Sets up the initial game state, including the snake and game status.
Adds a key listener for controlling the snake.

Game Loop:

Uses a Timer to repeatedly call the update and repaint methods.
The update method moves the snake, checks for collisions, spawns cherries, and checks for game over conditions.

Rendering:

The render method draws the current game state, including the snake, the cherry, the score, and game messages.


User Input:
The KeyListener inner class processes key events to control the snake, start the game, pause the game, and reset the game.

Snake Class (Detailed):

Movement:

Moves the snake's head in the current direction.
Updates the position of each tail segment to follow the previous segment.

Direction Change:

Changes the snake's direction based on user input, ensuring the snake cannot reverse directly.

Point Class (Detailed):

Movement:

Adjusts the x or y coordinate based on the direction and value.

Collision Detection:

Checks if two points intersect within a given tolerance.
Example Usage
The main class creates an instance of the Game class and adds it to the main window. The game panel (Game) handles all the game logic, while the main class simply sets up the window and starts the event loop.

Code Review and Potential Improvements

Exception Handling for Image Loading:

The current implementation catches and handles the exception for the cherry image loading, but it could be enhanced to provide more feedback to the user or to log the error.

Game Loop Efficiency:

The game loop uses a Timer, which is suitable for this simple game. For more complex games, a more precise timing mechanism like javax.swing.Timer or a custom game loop might be preferable.

Separation of Concerns:

The Game class handles both game logic and rendering. For larger projects, separating these concerns into different classes or packages would improve maintainability.

Scalability:

The current implementation is sufficient for a basic Snake game. If additional features or more complex game mechanics are desired, refactoring into a more modular design would be beneficial.

5.task :-

the Temperature Converter Application

The Temperature Converter application is a simple Java Swing-based GUI tool that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

Key Components
Main Window (JFrame): The primary window of the application where all components are displayed.

Input Field (JTextField): A text field where users input the temperature they wish to convert.

Unit Selection (JComboBox): Two drop-down menus for selecting the 'from' and 'to' units of temperature.

Result Field (JTextField): A non-editable text field that displays the converted temperature.

Convert Button (JButton): A button that triggers the temperature conversion when clicked.

Labels (JLabel): Text labels that provide instructions and indicate the purpose of each component
.
Functionality:-

User Input: Users enter a temperature value into the input field.

Unit Selection: Users select the units they want to convert from and to using the drop-down menus.

Conversion Logic: When the "Convert" button is clicked, the application performs the following:

Reads the input temperature.
Retrieves the selected 'from' and 'to' units.

Applies the appropriate conversion formula:

Celsius to Fahrenheit: 

(ùê∂√ó95)+32(C√ó 59)+32

Celsius to Kelvin: 

ùê∂+273.15C+273.15

Fahrenheit to Celsius: 

(ùêπ‚àí32)√ó59(F‚àí32)√ó 95
‚Äã
 
Fahrenheit to Kelvin: 

(ùêπ‚àí32)√ó59+273.15(Fx‚àí32)√ó 95+273.15

Kelvin to Celsius: 

ùêæ‚àí273.15K‚àí273.15

Kelvin to Fahrenheit: (
ùêæ‚àí273.15)√ó95+32(K‚àí273.15)√ó 59+32

Updates the result field with the converted temperature.
Error Handling: If the input is not a valid number, the application displays an error message in the result field.

User Interface Design

Layout: The application uses absolute positioning to place components, providing a straightforward and simple design.

Background Color: The main window background is set to light gray for a visually pleasant appearance.

Component Alignment: Labels and fields are aligned to ensure a clean and organized layout.

Usage

1.Launch the Application: Run the program to open the temperature converter window.
2.Enter Temperature: Type the temperature you want to convert into the input field.
3.Select Units: Choose the original and target units from the respective drop-down menus.
4.Convert: Click the "Convert" button to see the converted temperature in the result field.


This temperature converter is a useful tool for quickly converting temperatures across different units, demonstrating the practical application of Java Swing for building user-friendly graphical interfaces.
